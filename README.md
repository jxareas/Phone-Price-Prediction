<b><i>Phone Price Prediction</i></b>
</h1>

## Problem Description

Being a Mobile Developer, I'm passionate about all things mobile. Hence, in this Midterm Project, the task to tackle is
how
to predict the price of a phone based on its features like: the Operating System (Android / iOS), the prestige of its
brand (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO) and other technical specifications (battery, screen size, etc).

## Data

The data used in this project is the [**Mobile Phone Specifications and
Prices**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratikgarai/mobile-phone-specifications-and-prices) dataset, which can be
found in Kaggle.

Here is a detailed look of the features provided in the dataset, with their descriptions
and unit of measure (if applicable).

**Note:** *Some feature names are different from those of the actual dataset, which are cleaned.*
